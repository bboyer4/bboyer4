                        <p>This is a map displaying the results of the 2020 United States Presidential Election in Pennsylvania. The map was created using ArcGIS Pro and shows whether each county in Pennsylvania voted for Joe Biden and Donald Trump and what the percentage was. Counties that voted for Trump are in red and counties that voted for Biden are in Blue with the saturation of each color indicating the percentage of the vote. This map aims to provide a clear visual of the voting percentage breakdown in Pennsylvania during the 2020 election by county. </p>
                        <p> To create this map, I joined data containing the geography of PA Counties with a County Voting Data Table. I then made a choropleth map using bivariate colors. The light red-dark red color scheme indicates Trump voting percentages and the light blue-dark blue color scheme indicates the percentage of votes for Biden with darker saturation indicating a higher percentage and lighter saturation indicating lower.</p>

                        <p> This map is a choropleth map displaying the homicide density in Chicago by police district. The problem this map aimed to address was to see how homicides could impact tourism in Chicago. The first objectives was to describe the spatial distribution of the density of homicides by police district in Chicago The second objective was to compare the spatial patterns of homicides, Airbnb listings, and Airbnb prices in Chicago </p>
                        <p> To create this map, I first had to create a field containing the value of Area by square mile. Once I calculated the area, I joined the table containing this value to the tables containing AirBnb review and homicide data. I then used the Calculate Field option to calculate the density of Airbnb reviews and homicides by police district. <p></p>
                      <h2 class="section-heading">Philadelphia Healthy Food Store Location Candidates </h2>
                        <img src="https://github.com/bboyer4/bboyer4/raw/main/Candidates.jpg" width="600" height="500">
                        <p> This map shows the possible locations for a new store containing healthy foods in Philadelphia. The objective of this map was to find a target location in Philadelphia for the development of a new store selling healthy foods. The criteria was that the store had to be: within a Philadelphia empowerment zone; within 2,000 feet of a subway or regional rail station; not within 1,200 feet of a farmers market or corner store participating in the Healthy Corner Store Initiative; and preferably within a larger, contiguous area to increase the likelihood of securing a property. </p>
                        <p> To create this map, I first created buffers around the train stations and stores selling healthy foods, taking into account the distances specified in the criteria. Then, I used the union function to unite the buffers for the train stations and stores. For the united train station buffers, I used the intersect function to intersect this layer with the empowerment zones. Then, I used the erase function to only show areas that were within 2,000 feet of the train stations but not within 1,200 feet of stores selling healthy food. Finally, in the attribute table,  I used the multipart to singlepart operation so that each polygon was represented by one record and I then created and calculated a field for the area of each polygon in square feet. </p>
